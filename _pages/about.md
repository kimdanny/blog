Currently a 2nd year BSc Computer Science student at University College London.
I am particularly passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
To request my CV, please send me an [email](mailto:dannykim153@gmail.com).  

As a title of this blog (**TEKnology**) implies, this is a Tech-related blog posting site by *To Eun Kim (TEK)*  

By the way, if you can understand Korean, you can check out my [Korean blogging site](https://teknology.tistory.com) as well :)

  *Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)*  
  AI School 실무자 양성과정 3기 (@양재 R&CD 혁신허브 with KAIST & 모두의 연구소 sponsored by Seoul City Government)
  On June, took an intensive Machine Learning and Data Science online pre-course, provided by the BootCamp. 
  From July to August by attending 5 hours of lectures 5 days a week, I covered much deeper part of it, 
  including CNN, RNN and NLP to name just a few. 
  During the last two months, two group projects (Kaggle Titanic & Deep Neural Style Transfer) 
  and an individual project (MINIST Digit Recognizer) were proceeded and delivered a presentation on the last day.
  
* **Invited Participant at Bank of America Merrill Lynch**  
  *October 2018 / London, UK / at UCL*
  Invitation-only technical workshop.
  Found out more about the important role of 'Technology division' has in the running of their business. 
  Had the chance to do network with a number of representatives from Analyst up to Director level. 
  Was given an insight into the campus programs, and what they look for in students.

* **Google Technical Workshop**  
  *October 2018 / London, UK / at UCL*
  Google Technical Workshop / Engineering at Google (hosted by UCL technology society)
  Google engineers pulled back the curtains on the interview process and walked through a practice question. 
  Took part in a tech talk on the the Google Calendar backend services. Learned about software and site reliability engineering, 
  as well as engineering at Google in general.

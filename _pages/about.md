Currently a 2nd year BSc Computer Science student at University College London.
I am particularly passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

As a title of this blog (**TEKnology**) implies, this is a Tech-related blog posting site by *To Eun Kim (TEK)*  

By the way, if you can understand Korean, you can check out my [Korean blogging site](https://teknology.tistory.com) as well :)

  On June, took an intensive Machine Learning and Data Science online pre-course, provided by the BootCamp. From July to September, by attending 4-5 hours of lectures 5 days a week, I will be covering much deeper part of it, including ANN, CNN, RNN, GAN, RL, NLP and Computer Vision. During the last two months, one group project will be proceeded and be presented on the last day.

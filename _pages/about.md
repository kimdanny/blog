Currently a 2nd year BSc Computer Science student at University College London.
I am particularly passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
To request my CV, please send me an [email](mailto:dannykim153@gmail.com).  

As the title of this blog (**TEKnology**) implies, this is a Tech-related blog posting site by *To Eun Kim (TEK)*  

By the way, if you can understand Korean, you can check out my [Korean blogging site](https://teknology.tistory.com) as well :)

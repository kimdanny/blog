## Danny Toeun Kim

I'm a final year [M.Eng. Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/undergraduate/computer-science-meng) student 
at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).
I am particularly into NLP, knowledge representation, Information Retrieval 
and various applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
Currently, I'm focusing on developing a task-oriented dialogue system that is to be deployed on Amazon Alexa
as a participant of [Amazon 2021 Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge](https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize).
At the same time, I am working with Prof. [Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/) and [Aldo Lipani](https://aldolipani.com) 
at [UCL Web Intelligence Group](http://wi.cs.ucl.ac.uk) as an undergraduate researcher.

Before joining Web Intelligence Group, at [UCL Human-Computer Interaction Centre](https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk) 
I was researching a way to cluster smell-related texts in a similar way we perceive smell in real world.
A [literature review](https://github.com/kimdanny/Olfactory-NLP/blob/main/An%20NLP%20approach%20to%20classify%20smell%20experiences.pdf) 
and a [research paper](https://github.com/kimdanny/Olfactory-NLP/blob/main/Exploring_the_potential_of_automating_the_process_of_clustering_smell_stories.pdf) can be seen here.  
In summer 2020, working as a Data Analyst at [KB Securities](https://www.kbsec.com/go.able?linkcd=m50030032), 
I piloted two projects: **1)** Fund (mutual fund) recommender system and personalized advertisement (closed-source). **2)** [Stock price prediction system](https://github.com/kimdanny/Quant)
based on LSTM network trained on daily news natural language data.  
During my 2nd year at UCL, I developed a task-oriented chatbot at [RCGP](https://www.rcgp.org.uk).
The bot assisted med-tech companies in checking 
British healthcare software compliance regime, which makes longer time-to-market and delay in cash flow.  

I am always eager to learn new things and teach what I love to others by joining various types of societies, 
such as [NLP paper reading group](https://github.com/jiphyeonjeon/season2), Bootcamps, and university society 
(Check out [UCL Artificial Intelligence Society](https://github.com/UCLAIS), where I'm serving as a committee for three years).

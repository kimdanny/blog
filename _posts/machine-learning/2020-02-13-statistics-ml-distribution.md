Computer Scientists learn statistics. Why is that? You can give tons of reasons if you had to answer, 
but during this Series, I want you to view statistics from Machine learning's point of view 
and feel the need of statistical background once you decided to study ML deep enough.  

When you study machine learning you can easily encounter to terms like `naive bayes`, `bayes optimisation`, `maximum likelihood` or `cross entropy`.

So here we go. 
This is my first post of `Statistics in 'X' - #N 'X'` Series, and today's topic is Statistics in ML, focusing on **Distributions**.

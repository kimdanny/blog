Recommend reading from [the previous post](https://kimdanny.github.io/database/Introduction/).  

Now let's dive into the Database Language, SQL (Structured Query Language). We will learn MySQL.  

## 1. About SQL
**SQL** is non-procedural, transform-oriented, and standard language for relational databases and it stands for Structured Query Language.
It is actually a combination of a four different (but similar in some sense) languages.  
**DDL** (Data Definition Lang.) for creating DB,  
**DML** (Data Manipulating Lang.) for manipulating DB,  
**DQL** (Data Query Lang.) for retrieving information, and  
**DCL** (Data Control Lang.) for controlling access or giving permissions.

## 2. Understanding the Relational Database Model
![relational DB](/images/sql/relationalDB.jpg)   
[Image source](https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-sql-to-cypher/)  
SQL is about **Table Referencing**. In Relational Database Model, every data is stored in structured tables that are strongly inter-connected with each others.
Because everything is in table, it is okay to say data can be referenced by column and row. 
Also, one of the key concept of DB is that there are no duplicates of a row. Every row are unique, although the entities are not unique, set of entities, which is row, is unique.  

Here, we should know what a '**Primary key**' is. A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row in a database table. 
Primary keys must have unique values, which is not NULL. For example, let's say we are dealing with DB of Staff in one company.
The primary key for the table name 'Staff' can be something like 'Staff_No.', which is a unique number given to every staff.  

Remember this model is 'Relational'. There are many tables that are 'related to' each other. How can we relate one table to other(s)?
It's done by a '**Foreign Key**'. It is a field in one table that refers to the Primary key in another table.
This relationship can be termed by the really familiar relationship we always encounter; Parent-Child relationship. 
The table containing the foreign key is the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is the parent table.  

Additionally, there's one more thing called '**Composite key**'. It is literally a composite of several attributes, playing a role as Primary key.
It is when joined attributes uniquely identify each row in a DB.

### 3-1. Data types
```sql
INT             -- whole numbers
DECIMAL(5, 2)   -- decimal numbers of total 5 digits and 2 decimal digits
VARCHAR(10)     -- Variable Character of size 10
BLOB            -- Binary Large Object
DATE            -- 'YYYY-MM-DD'
TIMESTAMP       -- 'YYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
```

### 3-2. Creating DB and Making tables
Example of creating DB and making Tables: _(Example of EstateAgent is borrowed from Reference No. 1)_
```sql
CREATE DATABASE EstateAgent;

-- making it the current DB in use
USE EstateAgent;

-- Creating a table to hold data
CREATE TABLE Staff (staffNo VARCHAR(4), fName VARCHAR(20), sex VARCHAR(1), DOB DATE, salary DECIMAL(5, 2));

-- Inserting a row into a table
INSERT INTO Staff(staffNo, fName, sex, DOB, salary) 
VALUES ('AB01', 'Danny', 'M', '1984-01-01', 99000)

-- Let's say now we have many rows inserted in our DB, EstateAgent
-- Updating data in tables (Give all staff a 5% pay increase)
UPDATE Staff
SET salary = salary * 1.05
```


### 3-3. Querying data
Primary Clauses for retrieving data: 
```sql
SELECT    -- columns to appear
FROM      -- table to be used
WHERE     -- filters rows
GROUP BY  -- form groups of rows with the same column value
HAVING    -- filters groups subject to some conditions
ORDER BY  -- order of the results
```

## 0. Introduction to the IBM Quantum Experience (IBMQX)
The [IBM Quantum experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) is an online environment, created by IBM, 
which allows researchers, students and members of the public to design quantum computations, simulate their effect, 
and run them directly on prototype quantum computing chips in IBMâ€™s lab in the USA.  

From the first page, you will see the Dashboard of the IBMQX. Two main interfaces for building and running quantum circuits 
in the IBMQX are _Curcuit Composer_ and _Quantum Lab_.

_Circuit Composer_ allows you to create quantum circuits using its drag and drop functions, and run them on IBM's real quantum devices around the world.
_Quantum Lab_ is for advanced users. **Qiskit** is a powerful Python module for making and running quantum computations.
From Quantum Lab, you can directly edit and execute Qiskit codes within the IBMQX platform.

If you do software engineering or something similar, it is really useful to know UNIX Command Lines, especially
if you are developing a product under the UNIX-like Operating System, such as Linux or MacOS (Top 2 famous UNIX based OS).
For more information about Unix-like Operating Systems, visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like).  
One of the most appealing factors of using Unix based Operating System is because they share the Unix Command and Command-line Interpreter, so called, a Shell.  
These are superb and supportive features for programmers, because programmers can control the execution of the system at hand by using those.
Furthermore, shell scripting can boost the performance of the development process.  
Now let's find out some of the useful and good-to-know Unix Commands.

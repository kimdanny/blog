## To begin with...
Software Development life cycle consists of
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Quality Assurance
5. Maintenance

Every Software Engineering process goes through these 5 steps, 
and software development model is a methodology of how you are going to develop the software. In short, it is a series of building process.
There are many different types of model to choose when you develop a piece of software.
Obviously, a good software engineer is not only the one who have outstanding coding skills 
but also the one who choose right software development model in a given situation i.e. requirements.


## 1. Waterfall Model
Waterfall Method, I think, is the way that you can come up with fairly easily. It is, like its name implies, a linear sequence model
that starts from 'Requirement' stage and cascade over to 'Maintenance' stage, step by step.

## 2. Spiral Model
Unlike Waterfall Model, Spiral Model does not follow the linear steps. If I have to say, I would say it follows evolutionary way.

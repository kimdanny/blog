**To begin with...**  
Software Development life cycle consists of
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Quality Assurance
5. Maintenance

Every Software Engineering process goes through these 5 steps, 
and software development model is a methodology of how you are going to develop the software. In short, it is a series of building process.
There are many different types of model to choose when you develop a piece of software.
Obviously, a good software engineer is not only the one who have outstanding coding skills 
but also the one who choose right software development model in a given situation i.e. requirements.


## 1. Waterfall
![waterfall](/images/sw_eng_models/waterfall.png)  
Waterfall Method, I think, is the way that you can come up with fairly easily. It is, like its name implies, a linear sequence model
that starts from 'Requirement' stage and cascade over to 'Maintenance' stage, step by step.
Therefore, this model is easy to use and organise the workflow and people.
However, simplicity is not always the best option, as some risky disadvantages follow.
For its nature is linear, possible errors or risks are prone to be identified after completion of each stages.
Unfortunately, the lessons you learned after the completion of a certain stage do affect previous stages, so you may have to restart the whole cycle again.

## 2. Spiral
![spiral](/images/sw_eng_models/spiral.png)  
Unlike Waterfall Model, Spiral Model does not follow the linear steps. If I have to say, I would say it follows an evolutionary way.
As you can guess from the picture, Spiral Method complements the disadvantages of Waterfall Method.
You can fix errors as soon as you identify those, and while keep on proceeding the method, you make several prototypes, which is makes evolution at each time.
However, it has one weak point, where it only suits to a large scale project due to the high cost of managing the method.  

Quick Summary:

|      | Useful when requirements are stable and communication cost is high | Useful when Frequent requirement refinement is needed |
| cons |                   Not Flexible in constant changes                 |              Expensive for small projects             |
|      |             Lessons learned after affect earlier stages            |                                                       |

## 4. Agile



Many more models will be introduced here! Stay Tuned :)

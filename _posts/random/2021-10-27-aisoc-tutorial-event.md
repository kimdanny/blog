During 2020-2021, when we could not meet up and attend live lectures, 
we, UCL AI Society, had no choice but to open our ML tutorial events (Season 1) virtually on Zoom.  
Below, you can check our lecture recordings from season 1:  
[\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4JaWnfkTBbOLFG8xW5Ggtj_nRpgyDhIQ).  

Although it was a big success, we couldn't wait for this moment to come...  
Live lectures! Now that the Covid restrictions are far less strict than before, 
in 21/22, we are hosting our weekly live Machine Learning tutorials in big auditoriums!

You can take a look at some pictures below :)  

More than 160 students have turned out to our first lecture

We found the best lecture theatre for the large number of people
